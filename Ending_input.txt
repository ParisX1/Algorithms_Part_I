17. Q: My program is stuck.

A: It is waiting for standard input. 
The methods in StdIn require manually supplying the EOF(end of file) symbol at the end of input, 
which is achieved with: 
CTRL-Z 
in Windows 

CTRL/CMD-D 
in Linux/Mac. 

This holds true for input redirection in most modern IDEs run and debug configurations, including IntelliJ and Eclipse.
